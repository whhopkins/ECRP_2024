Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have confirmed many predictions of the highly successful Standard Model (SM), including the landmark discovery of the Higgs boson. Despite its success, the SM does not account for several observed phenomena, such as dark matter and the matter-antimatter asymmetry, thereby fueling the search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. Future LHC upgrades will shift focus from increasing energy to enhancing precision. Crucially, enhancing the identification efficiencies of physics objects, such as photons, and minimizing systematic uncertainties are vital for future breakthroughs in collider physics. Increased object identification efficiency effectively increases the usable data, akin to extending LHC operation times, while reducing uncertainties heightens the sensitivity to subtle deviations from SM predictions. This shift towareds precision comes sa machine learning (ML) has become an indispensable tool in High-Energy Physics (HEP), improving particle identification and the separation of signal from background processes. Nevertheless, ML's effectiveness is hampered by its sensitivity to data-simulation discrepancies and other experimental systematic uncertainties. The creation of a framework aimed at incorporating advanced domain-adaptation techniques into ML workflows to address these challenges.

This framework will leverage methods such as adversarial learning and distance correlation to enhance the robustness of ML models, making them more resilient against varied experimental conditions and simulation inaccuracies. Particularly, this will involve the novel "feature representation transfer" technique to generate universally applicable and robust features, enhancing both photon identification and energy measurement. The implementation of this framework is expected to reduce uncertainties significantly, thereby boosting the discovery potential at the HL-LHC, especially in precision measurements crucial for probing BSM physics. This framework is not limited to ATLAS but is poised to benefit a broad spectrum of experiments across the HEP frontiers, potentially revolutionizing how data is analyzed in collider physics. This initiative combines advanced computing resources, domain-specific expertise, and innovative ML techniques to set the stage for groundbreaking discoveries in the next era of the LHC, ensuring the full potential of the upcoming HL-LHC upgrades is realized.
