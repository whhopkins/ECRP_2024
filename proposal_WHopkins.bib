title = {Differentiable Earth mover’s distance for data compression at the high-luminosity LHC},
journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
abstract = {The Earth mover’s distance (EMD) is a useful metric for image recognition and classification, but its usual implementations are not differentiable or too slow to be used as a loss function for training other algorithms via gradient descent. In this paper, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a differentiable, fast approximation of the EMD and demonstrate that it can be used as a substitute for computing-intensive EMD implementations. We apply this differentiable approximation in the training of an autoencoder-inspired neural network (encoder NN) for data compression at the high-luminosity LHC at CERN The goal of this encoder NN is to compress the data while preserving the information related to the distribution of energy deposits in particle detectors. We demonstrate that the performance of our encoder NN trained using the differentiable EMD CNN surpasses that of training with loss functions based on mean squared error.}

abstract = {We consider the problem of learning from examples in layered linear feed-forward neural networks using optimization methods, such as back propagation, with respect to the usual quadratic error function E of the connection weights. Our main result is a complete description of the landscape attached to E in terms of principal component analysis. We show that E has a unique minimum corresponding to the projection onto the subspace generated by the first principal vectors of a covariance matrix associated with the training patterns. All the additional critical points of E are saddle points (corresponding to projections onto subspaces generated by higher order vectors). The auto-associative case is examined in detail. Extensions and implications for the learning algorithms are discussed.}
